\b;Objective

Create a function that moves the robot in the indicated direction.

\t;Instructions

See the code below:

\const;extern \type;void object\norm;::Mission3()
{
   moveTo(10, "north");
   moveTo(5, "east");
   moveTo(5, "south");
   moveTo(10, "west");
}
void object::mover(int dis, string dir){
   // you answer here
}

Copy this code and end it by creating the body of the \type;moveTo\norm; function. The \token;object\norm; in the name of this function allows it to access the properties of the robot from \const;this\norm;, which is fundamental to obtain the current position of the robot.

The following functions will be used in this mission:
   \c;\l;move\u cbot\move;\n; - moves forward or backward;
   \c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n; - rotates according to the given angle;
   \c;\l;direction\u cbot\direct;\n; - calculates the angle of rotation for the given position.
