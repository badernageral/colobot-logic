\b;Objective

Destroy all insects.

\t;Instructions

See the code below:

\const;extern \type;void object\norm;::Mission2()
{
	exterminateAnts();
	exterminateWasps();
	exterminateSpiders();
}

Copy this code and finalize it by creating the 3 functions indicated above. These functions do not return anything, so use \type;void\norm; as the return type of the function.

The categories are:
   - Ant: \const;AlienAnt\norm;;
   - Wasp: \const;AlienWasp\norm;;
   - Spider: \const;AlienSpider\norm;.

The following functions will be used in this mission:
   \c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n; - rotates according to the given angle;
   \c;\l;fire\u cbot\fire;\n; - shoot for the amount of time given;
   \c;\l;radarall\u cbot\radarall;\n; - capture information from multiple nearby objects;
   \c;\l;direction\u cbot\direct;\n; - calculates the angle of rotation for the given position.
