\b;Objective

Move the robot to a specific location.

\t;Instructions

From this mission you will begin to create your own \c;\l;functions\u cbot\function;\n;.

This mission is the same as Mission 5 in Chapter 4, that is, you must capture information from the trading posts, destroy them, calculate the position and move the robot there, but as we start working with functions, see the code below:

\const;extern \type;void object\norm;::Mission1()
{
   \type;int\norm; info[][] = collectInformation();
   \type;point\norm; pos = calculatePosition(info);
   \token;goto\norm;(pos);
}
\type;int\norm;[][] collectInformation(){
   // answer here
}
\type;point\norm; calculatePosition(int[][] info){
   // answer here
}

Note that the code above is the response of this mission, remaining to fill only the contents of the functions \type;collectInformation\norm; and \type;calculatePosition\norm;, you can reuse the code of the mission that you have already solved, so pay close attention to the code was written, we will follow this structure in the next missions.

While the first function has no parameters, the second expects as a parameter the information obtained from the exchange post, also notice that the two functions return values, that is, do not forget to use the statement \c;\l;return\u cbot\return;\n;.

The following functions will be used in this mission:
   \c;\l;goto\u cbot\goto;\n; - moves to the informed position;
   \c;\l;receive\u cbot\receive;\n; - requests information from a post;
   \c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n; - rotates according to the given angle;
   \c;\l;fire\u cbot\fire;\n; - shoot for the amount of time given.
