\b;Objective

Take the robot to the end of the spiral.

\t;Instructions

You should create a simple function that uses \c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n; and \c;\l;move\u cbot\move;\n;, then call it 8 times in the main function, each call with a different parameter.

If you are a good programmer your main function will have only 2 lines of code (excluding the braces) and the function you create will have only 4 lines.

The following functions will be used in this mission:
   \c;\l;move\u cbot\move;\n; - moves forward or backward;
   \c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n; - rotates according to the given angle.
