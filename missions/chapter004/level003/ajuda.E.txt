\b;Objective

Destroy the robots that are less than 15m from you.

\t;Instructions

The target category is \const;TargetBot\norm;.

After detecting all robots with \c;\l;radarall\u cbot\radarall;\n; and store them in an array, you must iterate over the array (use a loop to check each element), for this you will need to know how many elements the array has using the function \c;\l;sizeof\u cbot\sizeof;\n;:

\type;int\norm; a[] = {1,1,1,1,1};
\type;int\norm; b = \token;sizeof\norm;(a);

The value of \token;b\norm; is 5.

To calculate the distance between two positions use the function \c;\l;distance\u cbot\dist;\n;, for example:

\type;point\norm; a(5,5,0);
\type;point\norm; b;
b.x = 10;
b.y = 10;
b.z = 0;
\type;float\norm; c = \token;distance\norm;(a,b);

The value of \token;c\norm; is ~7 meters (7.071067812).

To know the current position of the robot, use:

\type;point\norm; r = \type;this\norm;.position;

The following functions will be used in this mission:
   \c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n; - rotates according to the given angle;
   \c;\l;fire\u cbot\fire;\n; - shoot for the amount of time given;
   \c;\l;distance\u cbot\dist;\n; - calculates the distance between two positions;
   \c;\l;sizeof\u cbot\sizeof;\n; - returns the number of elements in an array;
   \c;\l;radarall\u cbot\radarall;\n; - capture information from multiple nearby objects;
   \c;\l;direction\u cbot\direct;\n; - calculates the angle of rotation for the given position.
