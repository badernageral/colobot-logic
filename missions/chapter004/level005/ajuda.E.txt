\b;Objective

Move the robot to a specific location.

\t;Instructions

This mission has 3 trading posts, each with the same information: \token;v1\norm;, \token;v2\norm;, \token;v3\norm;, \token;v4\norm; and \token;v5\norm;, totaling 15 different values, you can collect them using the \c;\l;receive\u cbot\receive;\n; inside a \type;for\norm; loop, for example:

\type;receive\norm;("v"+\token;i\norm;);

Where \token;i\norm; is a variable of type \type;int\norm; which ranges from 1 to 5 and the operator \type;+\norm; is used for concatenation.

The challenge is to solve using only the variables below:

\type;int\norm; \const;info\norm;[3][5], \const;i\norm;, \const;j\norm;;
\type;point\norm; \const;pos\norm;(0,0,0);

Notice that \const;info\norm; is a array of two dimensions, where the first dimension represents the exchange stations by proximity to the robot, the second dimension represents the values from \token;v1\norm; to \token;v5\norm;.

You should collect the information from the nearest post with the function \c;\l;receive\u cbot\receive;\n;, then destroy this post with the \c;\l;fire\u cbot\fire;\n; function, receive the information from the second, destroy it, receive the information from the third and destroy it (file burning).

With all the information at hand, just calculate the position to where the robot should go.
Let's call the first post of A, the second of B and the third of C, with this in mind:

\token;pos\norm;.\type;x\norm; = Av1 * Bv1 * Cv1 + Av2 * Bv2 * Cv2 + Av3 * Bv3 * Cv3 + Av4 * Bv4 * Cv4 + Av5 * Bv5 * Cv5;

\token;pos\norm;.\type;y\norm; = Av1 / Bv1 / Cv1 - Av2 / Bv2 / Cv2 - Av3 / Bv3 / Cv3 - Av4 / Bv4 / Cv4 - Av5 / Bv5 / Cv5;

You can drastically lower the formulas above by using the \type;for\norm; structure.

To finish the mission, simply use the \c;\l;goto\u cbot\goto;\n; function to go \token;pos\norm;.

The following functions will be used in this mission:
   \c;\l;goto\u cbot\goto;\n; - moves to the informed position;
   \c;\l;receive\u cbot\receive;\n; - requests information from a post;
   \c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n; - rotates according to the given angle;
   \c;\l;fire\u cbot\fire;\n; - shoot for the amount of time given.
