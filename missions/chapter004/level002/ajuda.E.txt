\b;Objective

Detect the flags and follow the instructions to reach the final goal.

\t;Instructions

In this mission there are several types of flags, their categories are:
   - Blue flag: \const;BlueFlag\norm;;
   - Red flag: \const;RedFlag\norm;;
   - Green flag: \const;GreenFlag\norm;;
   - Yellow flag: \const;YellowFlag\norm;;
   - Violet flag: \const;VioletFlag\norm;.

The function \c;\l;radarall\u cbot\radarall;\n; can detect more than one type of object, simply inform an array of categories when calling the function. Knowing that a category is a constant of type \type;int\norm;:

\type;int\norm; cat[2];
cat[0] = \const;TNT\norm;;
cat[1] = \const;BlackBox\norm;;
\type;object\norm;[] bt = \token;radarall\norm;(cat);

The variable \type;bt\norm; will contain all the explosives (\const;TNT\norm;) and black boxes (\const;BlackBox\norm;) nearby, with this in mind, after detecting all the flags and storing them in a single array, do the following:

1) Go to the position of the 24th flag contained in the array;
2) Go to the position of the 52th flag contained in the array;
3) Move 2 meters towards the northwest;
4) Move 3 meters towards the northeast.

The following functions will be used in this mission:
   \c;\l;move\u cbot\move;\n; - moves forward or backward;
   \c;\l;goto\u cbot\goto;\n; - moves to the informed position;
   \c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n; - rotates according to the given angle;
   \c;\l;radarall\u cbot\radarall;\n; - capture information from multiple nearby objects.
