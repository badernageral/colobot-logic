\b;Objective

Detect the flags and follow the instructions to reach the final goal.

\t;Instructions

From this mission you will start working with \c;\l;arrays\u cbot\array;\n;.

The function \c;\l;radarall\u cbot\radarall;\n; returns all nearby objects according to the given category, that is, their return is an array of objects.
The category of the blue flags of this mission is: \type;BlueFlag\norm;. To detect all nearby blue flags, use:

\type;object\norm; b[] = \token;radarall\norm;(\const;BlueFlag\norm;);

The variable \type;b\norm; receives a array with all the flags, with this array in hand, do the following:

1) Go to the position of the 10th flag contained in the array;
2) Go to the position of the 51th flag contained in the array;
3) Move 2 meters towards the northeast;
4) Move 3 meters towards the northwest.

The following functions will be used in this mission:
   \c;\l;move\u cbot\move;\n; - moves forward or backward;
   \c;\l;goto\u cbot\goto;\n; - moves to the informed position;
   \c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n; - rotates according to the given angle;
   \c;\l;radarall\u cbot\radarall;\n; - capture information from multiple nearby objects.
