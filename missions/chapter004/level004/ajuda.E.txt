\b;Objective

Destroy the robots that are moving.

\t;Instructions

The target category is \const;TargetBot\norm;.

To know if a robot is moving, just store its current position in a variable, wait 1 second with the function \c;\l;wait\u cbot\wait;\n;, then check if the current position is the same 1 second ago, if it is different, it has moved and should be eliminated.

The following functions will be used in this mission:
   \c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n; - rotates according to the given angle;
   \c;\l;fire\u cbot\fire;\n; - shoot for the amount of time given;
   \c;\l;wait\u cbot\wait;\n; - wait a certain time in seconds;
   \c;\l;sizeof\u cbot\sizeof;\n; - returns the number of elements in an array;
   \c;\l;radarall\u cbot\radarall;\n; - capture information from multiple nearby objects;
   \c;\l;direction\u cbot\direct;\n; - calculates the angle of rotation for the given position.
