\b;Objective

Move the robot to the informed positions.

\t;Instructions

You will use variables of type \c;\l;point\u cbot\point;\n; in this mission.
These variables store a position, that is, x, y, and z coordinates, see an example:

\const;point \type;a \const;(\type;10, 20, 30\const;);\norm;

Where x=10, y=20 and z=30.
x represents right (+) or left (-)
y represents front (+) or back (-)
z represents up (+) or down (-)

The coordinates of the first point are x=-5, y=7.5 e z=0.
The coordinates of the second point are x=4, y=12 e z=0.
Move the robot to these coordinates using the \c;\l;goto\u cbot\goto;\n; function.

The following functions will be used in this mission:
   \c;\l;goto\u cbot\goto;\n; - moves to the informed position.
