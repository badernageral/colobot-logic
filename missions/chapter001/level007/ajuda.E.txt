\b;Objective

Move the robot to the positions of the objects detected.

\t;Instructions

Your robot can detect nearby objects with the \c;\l;radar\u cbot\radar;\n; function, with this in mind, we will use the \c;\l;goto\u cbot\goto;\n; function to move to the position of the detected objects.

To detect an object you must enter its type, the blue crosses are of type \type;WayPoint\norm;.
A variable of type \type;object\norm; will be used to store the information of the detected object, to access the position use the \type;position\norm; property.

\const;object \type;a \const; = \token;radar\const;(\type;WayPoint\const;);\norm;
\const;goto(\type;a.position\const;);\norm;

The following functions will be used in this mission:
   \c;\l;goto\u cbot\goto;\n; - moves to the informed position;
   \c;\l;radar\u cbot\radar;\n; - captures information from a nearby object.
