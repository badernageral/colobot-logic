\b;Objective

Move the robot to the positions obtained.

\t;Instructions

You should obtain the positions from the post with the \c;\l;receive\u cbot\receive;\n; function, create variables of type \c;\l;point\u cbot\point;\n; with the values obtained and use the \c;\l;goto\u cbot\goto;\n; function to go to these positions.

The name of the information that the information exchange post can provide is \type;x1\norm;, \type;y1\norm;, \type;x2\norm;, \type;y2\norm;, \type;x3\norm; and \type;y3\norm;.
The value of the \token;z\norm;-coordinate always will be 0.

The following functions will be used in this mission:
   \c;\l;goto\u cbot\goto;\n; - moves to the informed position;
   \c;\l;receive\u cbot\receive;\n; - requests information from a post.
