\b;Objective

Grab the explosive and take it to the position you have obtained.

\t;Instructions

In this mission your robot can carry objects, just call the functions \c;\l;grab\u cbot\grab;\n; and \c;\l;drop\u cbot\drop;\n;.

You should detect the explosive (type TNT) with the \c;\l;radar\u cbot\radar;\n; function, go to its position with the function \c;\l;goto\u cbot\goto;\n;, get it with the function \c;\l;grab\u cbot\grab;\n;, get the coordinates next to the post with the function \c;\l;receive\u cbot\receive;\n;, move to that position and drop the object with the \c;\l;drop\u cbot\drop;\n; function.

The information provided by the station is: \type;x\norm; and \type;y\norm;.
Keep in mind that if you are more than 10 meters away from the post the request will not be answered unless you increase the distance with a second parameter, for example, post at 100 meters distance:

\const;int \type;a \const; = \token;receive\const;(\type;"info"\const;, \type;100\const;);\norm;

The following functions will be used in this mission:
   \c;\l;grab\u cbot\grab;\n; grab an object;
   \c;\l;drop\u cbot\drop;\n; - drop an object;
   \c;\l;goto\u cbot\goto;\n; - moves to the informed position;
   \c;\l;receive\u cbot\receive;\n; - requests information from a post;
   \c;\l;radar\u cbot\radar;\n; - captures information from a nearby object.
