\b;Objective

Destroy the targets.

\t;Instructions

In this mission your robot can shoot, just call the \c;\l;fire\u cbot\fire;\n; function.

You must destroy all robots (type TargetBot) by using \c;\l;radar\u cbot\radar;\n; to get the robots position, then use \c;\l;direction\u cbot\direct;\n; to calculate how many degrees your robot should rotate to point toward the robot's position, rotate with \c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n; then \c;\l;fire\u cbot\fire;\n;.

\const;int \type;angle \const; = \token;direction\const;(\type;target.position\const;);\norm;

The following functions will be used in this mission:
   \c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n; - rotates according to the given angle;
   \c;\l;fire\u cbot\fire;\n; - shoot for the amount of time given;
   \c;\l;radar\u cbot\radar;\n; - captures information from a nearby object;
   \c;\l;direction\u cbot\direct;\n; - calculates the angle of rotation for the given position.
