\b;Objective

Move the robot according to the values obtained.

\t;Instructions

This is the same exercise as the previous one, except that this time you do not know how many times you have to repeat your code until you reach the end, so use the structure \type;while\norm; with a condition that will always be true, thus obtaining an infinite loop (be aware that even in this situation, the statement \type;break\norm; can be used to stop the loop).

Capture 2 values (type \type;int\norm;) from the exchange post: \type;m\norm; and \type;d\norm;.

First you must rotate the robot in the direction indicated by \type;d\norm;, where:
   North if \type;d\norm; is equal to 1;
   East if \type;d\norm; is equal to 2;
   South if \type;d\norm; is equal to 3;
   West if \type;d\norm; is equal to 4;

After rotating the robot, you should move it \type;m\norm; meters.

The following functions will be used in this mission:
   \c;\l;move\u cbot\move;\n; - moves forward or backward;
   \c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n; - rotates according to the given angle;
   \c;\l;receive\u cbot\receive;\n; - requests information from a post.
