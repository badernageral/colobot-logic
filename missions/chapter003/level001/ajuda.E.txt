\b;Objective

Move the robot according to the values obtained.

\t;Instructions

From this mission you will begin to use the structures \c;\l;for\u cbot\for;\n; and \c;\l;while\u cbot\while;\n;.

This is the same exercise as in the previous chapter, but instead of clicking the execute button 7 times, you will put your code inside a \type;for\norm; loop which will execute 7 times.

Capture 2 values (type \type;int\norm;) from the exchange post: \type;m\norm; and \type;d\norm;.

First you must rotate the robot in the direction indicated by \type;d\norm;, where:
   North if \type;d\norm; is equal to 1;
   East if \type;d\norm; is equal to 2;
   South if \type;d\norm; is equal to 3;
   West if \type;d\norm; is equal to 4;

After rotating the robot, you should move it \type;m\norm; meters.

The following functions will be used in this mission:
   \c;\l;move\u cbot\move;\n; - moves forward or backward;
   \c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n; - rotates according to the given angle;
   \c;\l;receive\u cbot\receive;\n; - requests information from a post.
