\b;Objective

Move the robot according to the values obtained.

\t;Instructions

Capture 2 values (type \type;int\norm;) from the exchange: \type;v1\norm; and \type;v2\norm;.

Perform in sequence:
1) If double of \type;v1\norm; is less than or equal to 50, move 5 meters north; if larger, move 8 meters north;
2) If the product of \type;v2\norm; by 3 is greater than 15, move 1 meter toward the northeast; if the rest of the division of \type;v2\norm; by 3 equals 0, move 2 meters toward the northwest; if the quotient of \type;v2\norm; by 5 equals 1, move 3 meters toward the southwest; if nothing works, move 4 meters toward the southeast.

The following functions will be used in this mission:
   \c;\l;move\u cbot\move;\n; - moves forward or backward;
   \c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n; - rotates according to the given angle;
   \c;\l;receive\u cbot\receive;\n; - requests information from a post.
