\b;Objective

Move the robot according to the values obtained.

\t;Instructions

Capture 3 values (type \type;int\norm;) from the exchange post: \type;v1\norm;, \type;v2\norm; and \type;v3\norm;.

Perform in sequence:
1) If \type;v1\norm; is greater than 5 or \type;v2\norm; is less than 5, move 15 meters toward the northeast; if \type;v2\norm; is even and \type;v3\norm; is odd, move 10 meters toward the north; if nothing works, move 5 meters toward the northwest;
1.1) If the first condition of item 1 is true, check after moving if the value of \type;v1\norm; is equal to 5, if true, move 4 meters to the east, otherwise, move 4 meters to the west;
1.2) If the second condition of item 1 is true, check after moving if the value of \type;v2\norm; is greater than or equal to 10, if true, move 3 meters toward the southwest, otherwise move 3 meters toward the southeast;
1.3) If neither the first nor the second condition of item 1 are true, check if the value of \type;v3\norm; is less than 5, if true, move 2 meters towards the north, otherwise move 2 meters towards the south.

The following functions will be used in this mission:
   \c;\l;move\u cbot\move;\n; - moves forward or backward;
   \c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n; - rotates according to the given angle;
   \c;\l;receive\u cbot\receive;\n; - requests information from a post.
