Move the robot according to the values obtained.

Capture 2 values (type \type;int\norm;) from the exchange post: \type;m\norm; and \type;d\norm;.

First you must rotate the robot in the direction indicated by \type;d\norm;, where:
   North if \type;d\norm; is equal to 1;
   East if \type;d\norm; is equal to 2;
   South if \type;d\norm; is equal to 3;
   West if \type;d\norm; is equal to 4;

After rotating the robot, you should move it \type;m\norm; meters.

When your program is finished, click \token;7 times\norm; in the button to run the program  (click only when the previous run ends).
